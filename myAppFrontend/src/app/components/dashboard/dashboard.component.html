        A significant breakthrough in solar energy technology has emerged from the University of Oxford, where physicists have developed a technique that could potentially double solar power efficiency to 45%. The innovation centers on replacing traditional silicon-based solar panels with an ultra-thin, flexible coating of multiple light-absorbing layers based on perovskite material.

        Led by Professor Henry Snaith, the research team has created a material just one micron thick—approximately 150 times thinner than traditional silicon wafers—that has been independently certified to achieve 27% energy efficiency. This already approaches the maximum efficiency of existing solar cell technology. The versatile material can be applied to various surfaces, from buildings to everyday objects like backpacks or mobile phones.

        The breakthrough is particularly significant because it combines perovskite with silicon to utilize more of the sun's light spectrum, as each material absorbs different wavelengths of light. This advancement comes at a crucial time as solar energy currently accounts for only 4.5% of global electricity generation. While the innovation shows immense promise for advancing clean energy technology, researchers are still working to address perovskite's sensitivity to water and heat degradation, which currently presents challenges for large-scale production. The team plans to publish their detailed findings later this year, marking a potential turning point in solar energy efficiency.
