      This chart shows the progression of solar cell efficiency over recent years,
      highlighting the significant jump expected from the Oxford team's perovskite
      innovation. The data illustrates the evolution from traditional silicon-based
      cells (around 22% efficiency) to the projected 45% efficiency achievable with
      the new perovskite technology.
